When looking at the information it can be determine that vehicle weight, spoiler angle, and AWD are likely to provid non-random amount of variance due to their coefficients.

While examining our p-value, 5.35e-11, it can be determine that our slope will not be zero as our assumed significance is 0.001 and the p-value is less.

Additionaly, when examining our R-Squared value, 0.7149, ~71% of the time the mode will be able to predict the mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively. 

## Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils

When examining the summary it can be determine that Lot 3 contains a greater variance and standard deviation of the suspension coil compared to both Lot 1 and 2. Additionaly, Lot 3 mean and median are different to Lot 1 and 2, in which both are equal to each other.
